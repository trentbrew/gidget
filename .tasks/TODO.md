Given that foundational elements like the chat component, vector database, branding, GitHub repo, and deployment pipelines are in place, we can narrow our focus to coding and feature-building. Here's a **23-hour breakdown** with an emphasis on momentum, interdependencies, and delivery.

### **Adjusted Hour Allocation Plan**

#### **Core Functionality: Day 1 (8 Hours)**

1. **Integrate Custom AI Package (4 Hours)**

   - [ ] **2 Hours**: Gemini Nano setup for local-first processing (fine-tune functionality to align with your vector database).
   - [ ] **1.5 Hours**: Embed generation for notes (integrate with note structures and ensure embeddings are searchable).
   - [ ] **0.5 Hours**: Memory system for context retrieval (test embedding queries against memory).

2. **Notes & Notebooks System (4 Hours)**

   - [ ] **1.5 Hours**: Local storage architecture (ensure seamless, robust storage with offline persistence).
   - [ ] **1.5 Hours**: Rich text editor functionality (core editor with basic formatting).
   - [ ] **1 Hour**: Markdown editor alternative (build and test rendering/conversion).

#### **Knowledge Management: Day 2 (8 Hours)**

1. **Web Scraping Capabilities (4 Hours)**

   - [ ] **2 Hours**: Data extraction tools (identify target formats, design extraction logic).
   - [ ] **1.5 Hours**: Data visualization components (basic charting or mapping functionality).
   - [ ] **0.5 Hours**: Export functionality (CSV/JSON integration).

2. **Knowledge Graph System (4 Hours)**

   - [ ] **1.5 Hours**: Design relationship mapping between entities (define schema and ensure compatibility with your database).
   - [ ] **1.5 Hours**: Configurable database interface (CRUD for entities, relationships).
   - [ ] **1 Hour**: Manual/automatic graph management (UI or backend automation for common use cases).

---

#### **Integration, Privacy, and Documentation: Day 3 (7 Hours)**

1. **External Tool Integrations (3 Hours)**

   - [ ] **1 Hour**: Google Calendar + Drive (quick API integration for syncing).
   - [ ] **1 Hour**: Slack + Notion (ensure bidirectional sync where applicable).
   - [ ] **1 Hour**: Testing and troubleshooting all integrations.

2. **Privacy Measures (2 Hours)**

   - [ ] **1 Hour**: Local-first data storage (ensure compliance with privacy-first principles).
   - [ ] **1 Hour**: Data encryption and secure processing (set up encryption protocols).

3. **Documentation (2 Hours)**

   - [ ] **30 mins**: Reflection patterns.
   - [ ] **30 mins**: Tool use patterns.
   - [ ] **30 mins**: Planning patterns.
   - [ ] **30 mins**: Multi-agent collaboration patterns.

### **Critical Considerations**

- **Focus on Testable Units:** Build small, independently testable modules (e.g., rich text editor, entity CRUD).
- **Leverage Existing Components:** Connect the dots between chat, embeddings, and the graph early to avoid integration pitfalls.
- **Iterate on Integrations:** Test external tools and privacy measures in real-world scenarios to catch edge cases.

Does this plan align with the technical scope and your teamâ€™s coding velocity?
